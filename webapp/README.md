*** Nav Bar ***

Each html file has an include statement. To set the active link within the navbar, set the abbreviation to True. Inside the nav.html, jinja statements check which link should have the active class.

The navbar is built with bootstrap 5.1.3. The import links are in the head of nav.html.

*** Static file ***

Please don't rename the static folder!!! That's how flask wants you to store css files and it will give you errors if you change the folder name.
